Your Baby Club’s top prams of 2023:
Best Stroller for Toddlers- Maclaren Quest Arc
Our review-
It might feel like toddlers are on the go 24/7, but when they crash, they’ll need a place to sleep NOW. The terrible twos can be tough, and faffing around putting a stroller up mid-tantrum isn’t something you’ll want to be doing. Because of this, ease of use is key when shopping for a toddler stroller. A stroller is a perfect place to get your little one out of the sun, so UV sun protection is also key, and the opportunity to recline them back when an unplanned nap hits.
The Quest Arc comes with loads of great features to keep your toddler comfy, including adjustable leg rests and a huge canopy made up of 3 different panels. The seat is roomy for growing kids, and there’s four reclining positions instead of the three that most prams have.
What we like- 

Impressive canopy to keep your little one out of the sun all day 
Removable seat fabric that’s machine-washable 
Helpful storage pockets in the back of the seat

Who it’s best for- 

Busy toddler parents 
Travelling with toddlers

Dimensions- 104cm x 27cm x 25cm
Weight- 6.22 kg
Price- £295
Best Pram for Rural Living- Mountain Buggy Terrain
Our review-
If you live off the beaten track, or you’re just active parents who love to get out and about in the countryside, then you’ll want to see this Mountain Buggy Terrain. It’s a robust model, with tons of practical features to adapt to your lifestyle. 
The canopy has a super cool ‘follow the sun’ feature, which we haven’t seen before, and the big air-filled tyres make for a very smooth ride. We also LOVE the storage options that the Mountain Buggy Terrain has to offer, including a large basket, bottle holders, seat pockets, and canopy pockets. That’s way more than most prams offer!
What we like- 

7 different storage options
Hand brake option for hiking/jogging excursions as a family 
Two tyre options that can be swapped out depending on the terrain

Who it’s best for- 

Adventure loving parents
People living rurally 
Jogging parents

Dimensions- w 63cm, h 120cm, d 85cm
Weight- 29.48 kg
Price- £659
Best Luxury Pram-  Silver Cross Reef Pushchair Chassis & Seat Unit
Our review-
Silver Cross is a staple in the pram and baby industry, and they’ve been around for a whopping 140 years. The Reef pushchair was a new addition to their collection in 2022, and it’s meant to offer ultimate comfort for your baby with a luxury finish. 
While it folds down pretty small, it’s definitely not a compact pushchair compared to others, so if you have a small boot you might struggle to fit much else in. One exciting thing about the Silver Cross Reef is that the newborn carrycot can actually be taken off and used as a crib, as it’s safe for overnight sleeping! Perfect for that late night arrival at the hotel when you can pretty much guess they’ll have forgotten to put the cot in your room.
The pushchair seat is reversible, with an extendable canopy, double sun visor, and even a hidden ‘sun sail’ shade which keeps your newborn completely out of the sun when lying flat. The seat fabrics are also made from 100% recycled plastic bottles, so it’s perfect for the eco-conscious parents among us!
What we like- 

Eco-conscious materials 
One-handed recoil
Comfy harness padding 
Lots of canopy options 

Who it’s best for- 

First-time parents 
Eco-conscious parents 

Dimensions- w 61cm, h 30.5cm, d 71cm
Weight- 12.5kg
Price- £1020
Best All Round Pram- Mamas & Papas Ocarro
Our review-
Mamas and Papas is an established name that’s built up a reputation of reliability over the years, and the Ocarro travel system definitely follows suit for us. Suitable from newborn up until your little one is around 4 years old (22kg), the Ocarro pushchair is super versatile.
It’s suitable for rural and city living, and has a really easy to use one hand fold system. When you’re running late and have your hands full, you’ll thank yourself for this one!
The Ocarro’s sturdiness is one of its biggest selling points, so it’s not the most compact of the options out there. Still, when folded it easily stands up, making it easy to store it away. If you’re looking for the perfect balance of quality, versatility, and reliability, this one’s for you!
What we like- 

Easy one handed folding 
Double suspension foam wheels to match any terrain (with reflective trim for added visibility out and about)
Fully retractable hood so your little one can see what’s going on around them 
Parent and world facing options 
Comfortable ride for baby
Multiple different bundle options 

Who it’s best for- 

Public transport users
First time parents
Parents who like both country and urban living 

Weight- 13.5kg
Dimensions- w 59cm, h 37cm, l 76cm 
Price- £1096

Best Budget Pushchair- The Chicco Goody Plus
Our review-
You might not have heard of the Chicco Goody Plus, but it’s actually the next generation of the super popular Goody strollers they have. These guys have won the hearts of parents looking to avoid spending a fortune on a pram or stroller.
Known for its ‘magical’ one button fold, which was a fan favourite from the classic model, the Chicco Goody Plus is also compatible with the carrycot and car seat to make a 3-in-1 travel system if this is what you’re after-so it’s way more versatile.
Weighing in at just 6.9kg, it’s definitely one of the more lightweight of our picks, but might not be the best for public transport users who’ll be navigating up a lot of curbs and drops.
What we like- 

Lightweight
Affordable but still reliable 
‘Magic’ one button folding system
Large basket 


Who it’s best for- 

Pavement walkers who stay ON the beaten track
People with limited storage options 
City dwellers 

Weight- 6.9kg
Dimensions- w 46.5cm, h 56cm, l 25cm
Price- £179
Best 3-in-1 Travel System- Nuna Mixx Next
Our review-
This is the third generation of the popular Nuna Mixx stroller, and it’s got all of the much-loved features with some new and improved add ons. It’s not lightweight compared to some of the smaller models on our list, but for the amazing quality and durability, it’s still relatively compact. Plus, this new model has an updated folding system which cuts off a whopping 20cm to the folded length!
If you’re looking for a classy, luxurious looking travel system to meet all of your newborns’ needs, this is the one for you.
What we like- 

Includes an extendable, water repellent, UPF 50+ canopy (featuring a flip out eyeshade, ventilation panel, AND a window)
Very responsive brakes
Lots of add on options 
Handy mobile phone pocket

Who it’s best for- 

First time parents
Parents looking for a stylish all-in-one

Weight- 11.09 kg
Dimensions- w 60cm, h 110cm, l 82cm
Price- £1,200
Best Lightweight- Babyzen Yoyo2 with Newborn Pack
Our review-
We love how nippy this little pram is, while still being super high-quality. You might have heard of Babyzen before when they shot to fame for bringing out the first buggy to fit in the overhead compartment of an aeroplane. While they’ve now been joined by a long list of competitors, this updated model shows that the Babyzen is definitely here to stay.
It’s a four-wheel pram with an impressive suspension system. And, unlike a lot of prams, if you do happen to notice the wheels wearing down, you can just pick up an extra set of wheels and there’s no need to fork out for a full new pram.
You might take a double take when you notice how compact this little pram is, but you know what they say, good things come in small packages. This pram definitely stands true to this mantra! If you walk into the airport with your Babyzen, they’ll definitely recognise it, and you’ll have the added satisfaction of walking past everyone else waiting for their pushchairs to come round the luggage claim (we all know they’ll be the last things off the plane).
What we like- 

Cabin/car friendly 
A pop up canopy with 2 positions
Extras such as rain cover included as standard with the pram 
Lightweight but still strong and durable
Modern, stylish design

Who it’s best for- 

Jet-setters who love to travel  
Parents who use public transport 
Those living in cobblestone villages 

Weight- 6.6 kg
Dimensions- w 52cm, h 44cm, l 18cm
Price- £614.95
Best All-Terrain Pram- iCandy peach all-terrain
Our review-
If you enjoy a walk to the local coffee shop in town as much as a walk in the woods, this is the one for you. The iCandy peach all-terrain is one of the most versatile prams out there, and it should be able to keep up with your family’s adventures.
One of the ways that it makes this look so easy is the ability to change it from a three-wheeler to a four-wheel buggy. It also comes with one of the best quality rain covers out there, so you won’t have to let the British weather keep you indoors!
The air-filled tyres are perfect for navigating bumps, and the added suspension makes for a pretty smooth ride for your little one, regardless of the terrain.
What we like- 

Large basket that’s super easy to access 
3 or 4 wheel option
Amazing suspension 

Who it’s best for- 

Parents who need the best of both worlds from country to city living 
Those who like a rainy walk 

Weight- 13.5 kg
Dimensions- h90cm, w 50.5cm, l 73cm
Price- £1080
City Living- Baby Jogger City Tour 2

Our review-
Don’t let the ‘jogger’ in the name deceive you, this 4 wheel model is perfect for everyday urban living. This pram's near-flat seat recline makes it the ultimate pushchair that every city dweller needs from the newborn stage. 
Like the ‘City Tour’ in the name suggests, this pram is perfect for manoeuvring in and out of busy streets and crowds. And, if you’re going home to a smaller-than-ideal flat at the end of the day, the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 folds up super well to be stored away (85% smaller than when it’s unfolded).
What we like- 

Reasonable price

Who it’s best for- 

City dwelling families
Families who love to travel 
People with limited storage

Dimensions- w 49.5cm, h 99cmFolder dimensions- 59.5 x 49.5 x 19 cm
Weight- 6.5 kg
Price- £284
Prams, Buggies, Pushchairs, Travel Systems: What’s the Difference?
Choosing the pram that’s right for you and your baby is a huge decision. After everything for the nursery, it’s probably the most expensive purchase that you’ll make for your little one, so you want to make sure to get it right.
If you’ve just started your research on the best brands of prams out there, or the best prams for a newborn, one thing that might have seemed a little confusing is the sheer number of different names that there are out there for 4-wheeled things used to push a baby around. We get it, it can be a lot to take in!
Here’s the key differences between each so it’s a little easier to work out what’s best for you.

Pram- Prams are typically the main choice for newborns and younger babies, and an essential for most new parents. They let the baby lie flat, which is the best position for newborn babies to be in according to safe sleep guidance. Prams tend to be parent facing, coming with a bassinet/carrycot, and many of them can fold flat.


Pushchair- As the name somewhat gives away, a pushchair is basically a chair on wheels for your baby. They’re made for older babies, usually older than six months, that can comfortably sit up on their own and don’t need to be laid flat in a pram anymore. Most pushchairs have settings that let the baby parent-face as well as outward face so they can take the big world around them in.


Buggy- The definition of a buggy might vary depending on who you’re talking to. Lots of people use the term interchangeably with ‘pushchair’, but they are typically a bit lighter weight and travel friendly than a standard pushchair. Usually quite a bit cheaper than pushchairs, and easy to manoeuvre, but might not be quite as durable for full time use.
Travel System- A travel system is basically a 2-in-1 pushchair that comes with a car seat, or a 3-in-1 pushchair with a car seat and a carry cot. Newborn travel systems are super popular options for new parents, both for the possible price savings and the functionality. If you’re looking for a pram with a car seat, all parts of a travel system will be interchangeable, meaning that you can switch between attachments depending on what you’re doing throughout the day. 

When Should You Buy a Pram?
The only real answer to when you should buy a pram, is whenever is right for you! If you’ve done all your research, found the pram that you want, and found an amazing deal while you’re 20 weeks- just buy it! The only real thing to consider is whether you have space to store it for the months before baby arrives. You might have heard the old wives tale that it’s bad luck to have the pram in the house before the baby is born, but realistically it’s not going to have the power to impact anything. 
The main thing when buying your pram is that you don’t leave it too late. Like we mentioned, a pram is probably the biggest purchase you’ll make for your little one. Plus, if you’re looking at an all in one travel system, you’ll need to make sure you have it to bring your little one home from the hospital. 
Ideally, we’d recommend having it at home and ready from around 35 weeks, so you want to be ordering it around 33 weeks. This gives you some leeway for delayed delivery of the pram, early delivery of your little one, and some time to play around and get used to how it works ahead of time!
Trust us, neither of you want to be faffing around getting it out of the box as you get ready to leave the house for the first time with your baby. Get it set up and practice folding it away, putting it in the boot, and even changing the attachments. Anything to make your life easier during the newborn stage!
Do My Car Seat and Pram Need To Be From the Same Brand?
If you want to buy a particular pram, but have noticed that the brand doesn’t actually offer a travel system or car seat to go with it, you’re probably wondering whether it’s worth buying. Or you’ve got your eye on a pram but the car seat that ticks all your boxes is from somewhere else, or the car seat that matches your pram isn’t compatible with your vehicle. What lots of people don’t realise is that most of the big brands’ prams and pushchairs can now be used with car seats from other brands. That changes everything, we know! 
You might need to buy an adaptor to make the connection, but these aren’t expensive, and if you’ve found the car seat that’s right for you in every other way, it can definitely be worth it. With most new prams and pushchairs being compatible with separate car seats, the need to find a travel system that meets all of your needs is less important than it has been in recent years. You now have way more flexibility and more options to find the perfect combination! 
How To Choose a Pram?
So, you’ve seen all of the pram options out there and you’ve been left wondering how you could ever narrow it down to just one. Hey, we’ve been there! Before you look through our top picks of the best prams out there, there are a few questions you can ask yourself to help choose the pram that’s best for you.
How Big is Your Boot?
This is one thing that we often hear our community members complain about. Imagine this, you’ve just got the dream car that you’ve always wanted, only to find out six months later that there’s no way you’re fitting even a foldable pram in that boot. Or you’ve had your eye on the perfect pram for your little one, only to find out it doesn’t fit in your car. Disaster! 
 When talking boot space, car manufacturers tend to measure in terms of litres. For a foldable pram to comfortably fit, you’ll be wanting to make sure your boot is around 380-400 litres in size. You probably don’t know the size of your boot in litres off the top of your head…but a quick google search of the make and model should let you know.
 Another way to work out if it fits, is to find out the folded dimensions of your pram, which can usually be found on the manufacturer’s website, and then head to your car with a tape measure and check the internal dimensions, taking into account the wheel arches, parcel shelf and room for shopping!
What Accessories Would You Make Most Use Of?
Accessories are definitely one of the biggest selling points. The 3-in-1 travel systems offered by brands have quickly become nine and twelve-piece bundles with accessories you never even thought you needed!
This is great, and can save you a lot of money compared to buying it all separately, but will you actually use all of the things they offer? If you already have a pram bag and pram toys from your last baby or passed on from a friend, it might not be worth going for a bundle including these accessories when looking to compare pushchairs.
Still, you might find the built-in foot-muffs to be a welcomed addition when you’re out with your little one on a crisp winter morning, or a rain cover included for our rainy British weather, or a cup holder invaluable for your coffee cup on your long strolls around the block to get baby to sleep. Before browsing through our pick of the best prams out there in our 2023 pram review, take a look at the different accessory options that come in the bundles, and make a list of the ones you think will be of most use to you. This will let you look through our top picks with an idea of what you’re actually looking for, and what might not be worth it. 
How Long Will It Be Until You’ll Be Buying Another?
With most prams and pushchairs coming with a pretty hefty price tag, you want to be thinking long term when you make your purchase. As we mentioned earlier, prams are the main choice for newborns and younger babies up to six months, while they still need to be lying flat.If you buy a travel system that can be used as a stroller once your little one is sitting upright, make sure to think ahead about what you might want at that time. If you think that having the option for your baby to face you as well as a forward face, make sure to check that the one you go for has this option. The last thing you want is to be buying a whole new pushchair in six months time if you can avoid it.
What Is a Bassinet Attachment and Do I Need One for My Pram?
 A bassinet attachment is a flat-laying bassinet that can attach to your pram, and is a safe place for your newborn to sleep. Many pushchair seats don’t recline all the way back to a flat position. This means that if your newborn was to lie back in one, their back would be slightly curved with their neck tilted forward. Without neck strength, this isn’t a safe position for your baby to sleep in. This also goes for car seats too.
Because of this, it’s recommended that young babies are only in car seats or capsule seats for less than two hours at a time. A bassinet is the perfect alternative where you can let your little one drift off without worrying and can be used indoors or out and about. So, if you’re pram shopping for your newborn, or your little one is still under six months old, you’ll want to look at a bassinet attachment to go with the pram. 
Do I Need a Foldable Pram? 
 Making sure to get a compact, foldable pram that can easily fold to fit in the boot of a car or for travelling is often thought of as a must-have feature for new mums. Depending on where you live, how often you’ll be out and about in the car or public transport with your baby, how big your car is, and other lifestyle factors, a good foldable pram can be super important, particularly once they’re older than 6 months.
Most pram and pushchair frames are fully foldable, but there’s definitely a lot of variation in how they fold, how compact they get, how heavy they are, and how easy they are to fold. Top tip: try not to focus on how compact a pram can go as the deciding factor. It might seem amazing that a pram can fold right down to a tiny size that can fit anywhere, and it can definitely help when out and about, but this can sometimes mean that the durability and sturdiness isn’t quite on par with the bigger, more robust models, especially if you’re after an all-terrain buggy.
Choosing a pram is a huge, expensive decision, and you’ve got to consider everything. After all, your little one will be spending a lot of time in there!
What is a Baby Travel System? 
 As a new parent, it can take a while to get your head around all the different items and compartments that you’ll need for your little one. Then, just when you think you know everything you need, they throw in the ‘travel system' -a whole system you didn’t know you needed!
In reality, a travel system might actually make your life a lot easier. It’s basically a pushchair that allows you to change the regular seat attachment to a bassinet or car seat. The main benefit is that you can seamlessly take your little one from their carseat nap and pop them on the pram, without ever waking them up. You might never even know what it means to be sat in your own driveway, nap trapped in the car! Most popular pushchairs are available as travel systems, meaning they can be purchased with a compatible car seat.
Choosing a Newborn Travel System: 
 We get it, choosing a pram was hard enough, now you’ve potentially got to put all of your eggs in one basket and entrust one system for your car seat as well? It’s a lot. But don’t let this put you off - there are loads of great travel systems out there that include rigorously tested car seats that you can trust. With car seat safety being the most important thing to most new mums, it can be best to choose your car seat first and then look at the travel systems available with it, rather than the other way around.
Aside from this, finding the best travel system for you is all about personal circumstances and preferences. Some common factors are:
Ability to convert to a double pram - If this is your first baby, and you know you’ll be wanting another little one in the not-so-far future, taking the time now to find a travel system that can convert into a double could save you loads in the long run.
Shopping basket - Again, this one depends on your lifestyle. If you live in a city, or don’t have a car, and think you’ll be out and about with your pram a lot, a large basket is an essential. The weight capacity for these baskets can vary from 2kg to 5kg, so if you’re a big shopper or like some hands free walking, it might be worth opting for one that can hold a bit more.
Reversible seats - If you want the option to have your little one facing you, as well as outward facing to take everything in around them, then the best travel system for you will be one that offers reversible handles/seats.
These are just some of the features to look out for. Keep on reading this guide to find the best travel system pram for you and your family.
Can You Use a Travel System for Toddlers?
Travel systems for newborns that include a car seat, or are compatible with particular car seats, normally all work with Group 0+ car seats. These seats can hold up to 13kg (though most car seats these days go by height rather than weight), and will last most babies until they’re 12-15 months old.
There are car seats out there that can last babies from a newborn until the age of four (Group 0+/1), but these stay fixed in the car and won’t work with a travel system for a newborn. This doesn’t mean that the travel system will be useless for you at this point, as you can definitely still use the pushchair seat component on the travel system, just not the car seat.
Is My Pram Safe? How to Check the Safety Aspects
 Pram, pushchair, and car seat safety is a HUGE topic, and one that all mums take seriously. There are strict British safety standards in place that govern all prams, strollers, pushchairs, and buggies
When looking into a pram and whether it meets the required safety standards, look out for either a code starting with ‘BS’ followed by four numbers, or ‘BSEN’ followed by numbers including the year of the recognition on the label or online description. 
Even if you know that the pram you’re looking at meets safety standards, it’s always best to see a model of the pram in person and work through some of the different safety elements. Try to check the following safety aspects to know if a pram is the right choice for you:

Brakes - Make sure that the brakes on the pram are easy to apply, and that the brakes are strong enough to properly bring the pram to a stop, even on an incline and with items in the storage section.


 Stability - When testing out the pram, make sure to test it out moving it around in different directions to check it won’t be tipping over easily. This is where bulkier, wide based prams tend to perform better.


 Safety harness - You’ll want to make sure that the pram or pushchair you go for has a five-point safety harness, rather than a three-point one. This will go over your baby’s shoulders, around their waist, and in between their legs, to make sure they’re properly secure. 
 Wheels - Make sure that the wheels are securely fitted to the pram, that they’re easy to maneuver, and that they’re the right type of tyre for the terrain you’ll be using it for.

How Long Will I Need To Use a Pram For?
 Like we’ve mentioned above, a pram or newborn travel system with a bassinet is what you’ll mainly use until your baby is six months old. At this age, depending on whether or not you buy a travel system, you might have to buy a separate pushchair, or change out the attachment of the travel system to the standard seat fitting where your little can sit more upright and hold their head up completely unsupported.
When it comes to the time of giving up the pushchair altogether, this doesn’t tend to be until your child is around three years old and can confidently walk with you. Everyone’s situation is unique, but if you’ve ever tried to walk somewhere with a toddler who doesn’t want to walk, you might think twice about giving up the pushchair!
How Much Should I Spend on a Pram?
 There’s loads to think about when deciding how much to spend on a pram and which pram to buy, and with prices ranging from £50 to way over £1500, it’s hard to know what is the best middle ground. A recent survey found that two in five parents spent between £100 and £300 on their pram, while 16% paid less than £100.
 As with most things, pushing the boat out for the most expensive pram model could see you paying a premium for the brand name to some extent. Look through our top picks of the best prams of 2023, and find the one that’s right for you.
