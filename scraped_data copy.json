My mother has been my biggest influence, and skincare had always been a ritual for her\u2014it was the time she\u2019d set aside to take care of herself. As a child, I always viewed this time as a luxurious and sensorial routine. Even now, the smell of certain Korean skincare products still reminds me of her. She\u2019s influenced my less-is-more approach to beauty. Not too perfect or too done. Beauty should be effortless, easy and fun.\"",

        "\"I was born in Taiwan and moved to the Seattle area when I was about three and a half. The culture is warm yet direct. It's amazing to have these wonderful comedians now like Ali Wong and Jimmy O that capture\u00a0this exact\u00a0dichotomy so hilariously. The directness of feedback\u00a0can be startling, but it's taught me to live in my truth. I know where I'm strong and where my weaknesses are and that's helped me build Ellis Brooklyn along the way. I think it's the same principle when creating fragrances with master perfumers. With scent, smells can be so tough to describe. We try to cut the old school fragrance marketing jargon and instead\u00a0be direct\u00a0with everyone on our team but also with\u00a0how we describe scent to our community.\"",

        "\"My parents are first-generation immigrants from Taiwan, bringing with them their traditional culture and work ethic that still resonates within my family today. Honestly, growing up in Australia made me somewhat foreign to our home culture until fate brought me back to the island. I met my head chemist (an amazing Taiwanese woman who\u2019s still responsible for new Snow Fox products), who suggested that I come and explore local proprietary production technology with her.\u2028\t\tAs we built our brand, my re-connection to Taiwan grew with it, and it definitely became a core influence on our brand\u2014even though our original concept came out of Australia. This heritage is very much part of me, and I\u2019ve always carried a deep respect of native flora in different regions and their traditional remedies and practices. This is applied to Snow Fox formulas through ingredients such as ginseng, Australian snowflower or astragalus root. Snow Fox is a blend of East and West, a reflection of me as its founder, and I am proud of that multicultural identity as an AAPI person.\u2028\t\tI believe that blended cultures (third cultures) will become more of a norm in the future, and this will be reflected in founders and their brands, just like it has with mine.\"",

        "\"I was born and raised in Australia as the\u00a0daughter\u00a0of Vietnamese refugees. Growing up I was often the odd girl out, not only for my Chinese/Vietnamese heritage but also because I suffered from severe eczema. As I had very few strong Asian female role models around, I looked to my Mom for beauty and skincare inspiration. I am so grateful to\u00a0my Mom for making me feel proud of my roots, the way I look and for always instilling a sense of grit and drive in me.\u00a0These experiences made me realize that one day I would love to launch my own skincare line.\"",

        "\"Being Iranian is my culture and heritage. It gives me the breadth to see and experience life differently. I\u2019ve been fortunate to be Iranian, raised in the States and now to live in the UK. Being a citizen of the world means I\u2019m curious to learn about different cultures, empathetic to differences in value systems and always evolving in how I see the world. I feel very blessed to have this uncommon combination. And I think that being a successful surgeon and entrepreneur from an area that\u2019s often critiqued for political and religious ideologies, I can also represent the beautiful side of a country richly rooted in history and culture and hopefully give a better understanding of a country and land I feel deeply connected to. MZ Skin is an alchemy of my total life experiences. Iranians pride themselves on their presentation. Skincare and maintaining beauty rituals is very much engrained within the women and men of the country, stemming thousands of years.

        "For this condition, blame your parents as it\u2019s genetic. Androgenic Alopecia occurs when hair follicles are sensitive to normal levels of androgens (a group of hormones that includes testosterone and androstenedione). \u201cIn response, follicles progressively and gradually shrink and produce hairs that are slightly finer and shorter,\u201d say Anabel Kingsley, president of Philip Kingsley and a practicing trichologist. \u201cAnything that impacts hormone levels\u2014like stress, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), menopause and certain birth control pills\u2014can make this worse.\u201d The effects compound over time, and the result is significant, diffuse thinning.",
        "If you\u2019re suffering from excessive daily hair shedding (aka Telogen Effluvium), you can\u2019t actually point the finger at Mom and Dad. Telogen Effluvium occurs as a reaction to an internal disruption, such as illness, a poor diet, rapid weight loss, stress, certain medications, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid imbalances or pregnancy. Telogen Effluvium starts 6 to 12 weeks after the event that triggered it. Some good news: \u201cTelogen Effluvium is not progressive,\u201d Kingsley says. \u201cOnce you identify the cause and fix it, hair loss will stop, and hairs will grow back as before.\u201d",
        "There\u2019s a third type of hair loss that\u2019s also widespread\u2014 Alopecia Areata, which manifests in patches. It occurs when the immune system attacks certain hair follicles in the anagen (or growth) phase of the hair lifecycle. Currently, there\u2019s no proven treatment, but, in many cases, hair will spontaneously grow back on its own. \u201cAvoid buying products that claim to regrow patchy hair loss\u2014they do not work,\u201d Kingsley says. \u201cThe only treatments that may be effective are solely available by prescription.\u201d",
        "To figure out which condition you might have, \u201cWe always advise starting with a self-assessment,\u201d says Debby Vellozzi, head of product development for Virtue Labs. \u201cTalking to your dermatologist, gynecologist or a functional medicine practitioner can also be helpful.\u201d",
        "Have I experienced recent changes in my health or am I taking any new medications?",
        "Has my diet changed or am I facing higher levels of stress?",
        "Is there a history of hair loss in my family and/or might I be experiencing hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, childbirth, perimenopause or menopause?",

The senseless deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many others are stark reminders of systemic and widespread inequalities that exist in our country. Many who have been silenced for too long are making their voices heard, and it is long past time for all of us to listen and to do what we can to create an America where freedom and opportunity are equally available to all.",

Nevertheless, we know that we need to do better to make sure that the culture within our walls makes the world a better place. As a first step, we will expand and have ongoing training to further educate our employees about unconscious bias and racism. In the months ahead, we will reach out to our employees to hear their experiences and find out how we can do better. At the same time, we will launch a mentoring program to help our team members take their careers to the next level. With our renewed efforts on diversity and inclusion, we are working to ensure a safe environment for discussion and change as we strengthen our commitment to an inclusive culture of love.",

Today, we have customers and colleagues across the country and the opportunity to help create change in a more meaningful way. We will commit to using our Bluemercury platform to begin a mentoring and launch program for beauty brands created by black founders. Supporting founders has always been part of who we are and we will start by partnering with SOGAL Foundation and their Black Startup Founder Grants program.",

As a young girl, I was immersed in a household of strong, entrepreneurial women who loved beauty. We\u2019re a total of 35 cousins and 20 of those are women, so there was a dedication to self-care. My grandmother would host spa parties in her house every weekend and invite all these women to come try her hair mask or body scrub. I loved helping her make the products from scratch using local Colombian ingredients. I would watch her teach the women how to take care of their skin and noticed how much more confident and beautiful they would feel afterward. From a young age, I had a growing appreciation for helping women embrace their individuality and be the best version of themselves. When I started to formulate my own products, I thought there was no better way to see if they worked than hosting my own spa parties. I would invite my close friends and family over, and I\u2019d walk them through some of the first regimens that we created. Trial and error and listening to the feedback of those I loved and trusted resulted in a line of products that are high performance and deliver incredible results.

        "The Laundress, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Health Canada, has issued a voluntary recall of laundry detergent and household cleaning products due to a risk of exposure to bacteria.",
        "The recalled products can contain bacteria, including Burkholderia cepacia complex, Klebsiella aerogenes and multiple different species of Pseudomonas, many of which are environmental organisms found widely in soil and water, and some may also be found in humans. People with weakened immune systems, external medical devices, and underlying lung conditions who are exposed to the bacteria face a risk of serious infection that may require medical treatment. The bacteria can enter the body if inhaled, or through the eyes or a break in the skin. People with healthy immune systems are usually not affected by the bacteria.",
        "If you have an impacted product, you should immediately stop using it. To find a complete list of impacted products and request a refund, go to www.TheLaundressRecall.com. If you have already submitted a request for reimbursement following our Safety Notice, there is no need to submit an additional request. However, please do check all your products to see if they are included in the final recall list. For further questions, email customerservice@thelaundress.com or call 800-681-1915 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday.",

        "Short for sun protection factor, this abbreviation followed by a number indicates how many times longer it will take for sunscreen-protected skin to burn than unprotected skin. For example, an SPF 15 sunscreen means it will take 15 times longer to burn than if you weren't wearing any sun protection.",

        "Physical sunscreens create an impenetrable shield against the sun's rays and are made with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. The particles in these ingredients sit on top of the skin and reflect all UV rays.",
        "TIP: These tend to be less irritating to the skin than chemical sunscreens. This is particularly beneficial for kids and individuals who have sensitive skin.",
        "Chemical sunscreens contain organic, carbon-based compounds that create a chemical reaction to convert UV rays into heat, which is then released from the skin without burning.",
        "TIP: Chemical sunscreens can take up to twenty minutes to absorb into the skin, so make sure to give yourself the appropriate amount of time to let it soak in.",
        "In the USA, the FDA only allows two claims, Water Resistant (40 min) or Water Resistant (80 min). These retain their stated SPF value for the specified time, in water or while sweating.",

        "To cover your entire body with sunscreen, it takes about one ounce or the size of a shot glass. Most people will under apply by about 50%.",
        "Sunscreen should be reapplied throughout the day because the active ingredients lose their effectiveness over time.",
        "Even if you believe you're covered, the sun's rays can go through clothing, and you can still get burned.",
        "Spray formulas are quick and easy to apply but you are more likely to miss spots and end up with uneven coverage. For your best protection, continuously spray for about five seconds on a particular area and then rub in thoroughly.",
        "The expiration dates printed on your sunscreen aren't just for show. From the moment you open your sunscreen, the clock starts ticking. Exposing it to direct sunlight can decrease its effectiveness, shortening its lifespan even further.",
        "The most common areas missed by sunscreen are scalps, ears, eyelids, lips and the tops of your feet. Try using sprays for your scalp and stick format for ears, eyelids and lips.",
        "Replenish and repair your skin after sun exposure with treatments that hydrate and sooth. After-sun care can prevent any skin irritation, redness and dryness. Sunburn can have a lasting effect on skin and treating your skin after being in the sun is beneficial.",

When you opt for colorful liner, you need to finish off your look with that Smith terms \u201ca good amount of mascara.\u201d Because while your bright liner will emphasize your eyes, definition usually comes from a darker shade, such as black or brown.

        "Prep makes perfect. You\u2019ve likely applied your moisturizer and sunscreen right before doing your makeup, which means that you\u2019ve probably got some lotion on your brow hairs. Unfortunately, that\u2019s going to prevent your brow product from adhering as well, and it won\u2019t last as long. To fix that problem, Lujan dips a cotton swab in a water-based makeup remover, then wipes it over the entire eyebrow. \u201cYou want to get down to the skin and really get off any of the makeup, oils, skincare, powder or concealer that\u2019s on the brow hairs,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you need a water-based product for this because an oil-based one will cause any makeup you apply afterward to bleed.\u201d",
        "Invest in a spoolie. You\u2019ll need to use it more than once when you\u2019re doing your brows. Lujan uses his to brush brow hairs straight up after cleaning them (see above), so that he can spot any bald patches. Smith presses hers into service as a final step. \u201cCombing through the hairs will blend in pencil or powder and also remove excess brow gel,\u201d she says. \u201cI sometimes find that the applicator that comes with those can deposit too much gel, and a spoolie is a great way to fix that.\u201d",
        "It takes two. Kate Synott, beauty creative director at R\u00f3en, likes to use more than one pencil. \u201cI select two shades\u2014one that\u2019s a little bit lighter than my client\u2019s natural hair and one that\u2019s just as dark as their hair, if not a fraction darker,\u201d she says. She uses the lighter shade to fill in patchy places. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go in with the darker pencil and create little false, feathery hairs, so the brow looks more natural,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you only use pencil the exact color of the brow, the result is going to appear blocky.\u201d",
        "Take it from the top. According to Lujan, most people fill in their brows by starting at the head of brow (the part closest to the nose) and working out. \u201cThey end up putting too much color there, which has the effect of pulling the brows a little closer together,\u201d he says. Instead, Lujan begins at the arch, sketching in a few hairs at a time on each side to ensure balance. Then he continues out to the tail, adding a bit of length to open the eye shape. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve gone from arch to tail, you can pencil in one hair at a time from body to head,\u201d he says. \u201cBut only in the areas that are sparse.\u201d",

Then comb through your curled lashes with a clean spoolie brush. \u201cThis is a step that most people neglect, and then they end up with clumpy lashes,\u201d Lujan says. \u201cSeparating them is going to give you that really nice, feathered lash effect.\u201d",
        "Be tactical with your mascara application. \u201cConcentrating mascara on the outer corners of your eyes helps create a more open and lifted look,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAnd a little bit more on the center lashes makes eyes look bigger and more awake.\u201d",

        "If you decide to apply multiple coats, don\u2019t rush. \u201cWet mascara needs to set about 30 seconds to a minute between coats,\u201d Lujan says. \u201cOtherwise, lashes are going to get weighed down.\u201d",

        "Work your way up. \u201cI like blush on the apples of the cheeks, then softly blended in an upward motion toward the cheekbones,\u201d Synott says. \u201cDon\u2019t go the other way because that would bring the face down.\u201d",
        "Don\u2019t be afraid to break the rules. \u201cI prefer using smaller brush for a cream blush,\u201d Smith says. \u201cSurprisingly, I love our #11 Soft Matte Complete Concealer Brush, which has a small, rounded head, which makes it easier to apply blush smoothly and precisely than a larger version.\u201d",

        "It\u2019s easier than you think. According to Kate Synnott, beauty creative director at R\u00f3en, doing a red lip is \u201cdefinitely easier than doing a smoky eye.\u201d She suggests pairing cream highlighter with your scarlet lipstick, so \u201cyou have this beautiful, glowy skin and then this statement lip.\u201d",
        "Go it alone, at first. The quickest way to confirm that you\u2019ve found the right red for you is to test it on a bare face. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need to build a full face of makeup around your red lip,\u201d Synnott says. \u201cIt should look good with very little makeup.\u201d",
        "Play matchmaker. Lining and filling your lips with pencil will ensure your lipcolor lasts (and lasts). And in response to the age-old question of whether your lip pencil should match your natural lip color or your lipstick, Kjaer Weis is confident: \u201cTo your lipstick.\u201d",
        "It\u2019s ok to say no. \u201cIf red doesn\u2019t work for you, it doesn\u2019t work for you, and that\u2019s totally fine,\u201d Reagan says. \u201cMy question is always, \u2018Are you really interested in a red lip for yourself or is it just because other people are wearing it?\u2019 That\u2019s the most important thing to ask.\u201d",
